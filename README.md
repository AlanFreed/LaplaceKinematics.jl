# LaplaceKinematics.jl

This module provides a **QR** or Gram-Schmidt factorization of a deformation gradient tensor **F** = *F·µ¢‚±º* **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º, where *i*,*j* ‚àà {1,2} for 2D analyses, or *i*,*j* ‚àà {1,2,3} for 3D analyses, with *F·µ¢‚±º* being its matrix of tensor components evaluated in basis (**e**‚ÇÅ, **e**‚ÇÇ) for 2D analyses, or in basis (**e**‚ÇÅ, **e**‚ÇÇ, **e**‚ÇÉ) for 3D analyses. Here **Q** = Q·µ¢‚±º **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º is an orthogonal matrix known as the Gram rotation tensor, and **R** = *R·µ¢‚±º* **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º is an upper-triangular matrix known as the Laplace stretch tensor.

In the mechanics literature, this decomposition is often denoted as **F** = **RU**, where **R** denotes a rotation and **U** denotes a stretch.

The deformation gradient is a mapping from one material configuration into another. It is a two-state property, independent of the path traversed between these two states. All deformations considered are to satisfy the following conditions: The deformation gradient **F** equates with the identity tensor **I** in its initial configuration Œ∫‚ÇÄ, i.e., its motion is Œ∫‚ÇÄ ‚Ü¶ Œ∫‚ÇÄ. All other deformation gradients associate with motions of Œ∫‚ÇÄ ‚Ü¶ Œ∫‚Çô, where Œ∫‚Çô is the configuration at current time t‚Çô. This includes a strain-free reference configuration Œ∫·µ£, which can be attained via a motion of Œ∫‚ÇÄ ‚Ü¶ Œ∫·µ£. The reference configuration Œ∫·µ£ is, by definition, free from strain; therefore, the initial configuration Œ∫‚ÇÄ may be a strained configuration, even though its deformation gradient is **F**(t‚ÇÄ) = **I**. This is a common occurrence in analyses done on biologic tissues.

## Kinematics of 1D Fibers

For one dimensional continua, their kinematic histories are stored in the data structure.
```
struct FiberKinematics
    # Properties of the arrays.
    dt::PhysicalScalar          # time increment separating neighboring nodes
    N::Int64                    # number of intervals along a solution path
    n::MInteger                 # a counter that ratchets from 1 to N+1

    # Reference (strain free) length of a 1D fiber element.
    Œª·µ£::PhysicalScalar          # reference stretch, Œª·µ£ = L·µ£ / L‚ÇÄ, L is length

    # History arrays are of length N+1 for holding the kinematic fields.
    # Initial values/conditions are stored in array location [1].

    # Array of the independent variable, viz., array of nodal times.
    t::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars   # time at the solution nodes

    # Arrays for the fiber stretch and its rate.
    Œª::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars   # stretches at the solution nodes
    Œª‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars  # stretch rates at the solution nodes

    # Arrays for the thermodynamic (true) strain and its rate.
    œµ::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars   # strains at the solution nodes
    œµ‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars  # strain rates at the solution nodes
end
```
where types `MInteger,` `PhysicalScalar` and `ArrayOfPhysicalScalars` are exported by module `PhysicalFields.` The fields comprising this type are self explanatory.

### Internal Constructors

The constructor most likely to be used by a programmer is
```
function FiberKinematics(dTime::PhysicalScalar, N::Int64, midPtQuad::Bool, lambdaRef::PhysicalScalar)
```
which returns a new data structure `k` of type `FiberKinematics` that holds kinematic fields pertinent for the modeling of a 1D fiber. Arguments are: (i) A differential step in time `dTime` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced over time. (ii) The total number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays, e.g., t[1] = 0. (iii) A boolean flag `midPtQuad` that, if true, implies the nodal spacing is for a mid-point quadrature rule, and if false, implies the nodal spacing is for an end-point quadrature rule. This determines how the array of independent times is to be populated. (iv) The reference (or strain free) stretch `lambdaRef` of a fiber against which strains are to be measured, viz., œµ(Œª·µ£) = 0, with the fiber's initial stretch Œª‚ÇÄ, associated with some initial configuration Œ∫‚ÇÄ, being assigned a value of 1 with an outcome being that œµ(Œª‚ÇÄ) need not equal 0.

The constructor used by JSON3 and other external constructors is
```
function FiberKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Int64, n::MInteger, Œª·µ£::PhysicalScalar, t::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œª::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œª‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars,œµ::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars)
```
which is a serialization of the fields comprising type `FiberKinematics.`

## Methods

### Copies

For making a shallow copy of an object of type `FiberKinematics,` use
```
function Base.:(copy)(k::FiberKinematics)::FiberKinematics
```
and for making a deep copy of an object of type `FiberKinematics,`, use
```
function Base.:(deepcopy)(k::FiberKinematics)::FiberKinematics
```

### Persistence

To write an object of type `FiberKinematics` to a JSON file, one can call
```
function toFile(k::FiberKinematics, json_stream::IOStream)
```
while reading in such an object from a JSON file can be accomplished by calling
```
function fromFile(::Type{FiberKinematics}, json_stream::IOStream)::FiberKinematics
```
wherein a `json_stream` for writing to a JSON file can be created from a call to
```
function PhysicalFields.openJSONWriter(my_dir_path::String, my_file_name::String)::IOStream
```
while a `json_stream` for reading from a JSON file can be created by calling
```
function PhysicalFields.openJSONReader(my_dir_path::String, my_file_name::String)::IOStream
```
with
```
function PhysicalFields.closeJSONStream(json_stream::IOStream)
```
closing a `json_stream.`

### Solver

To advance a solution along its path, step by step, call the method
```
function advance!(k::FiberKinematics, dLambda::PhysicalScalar)
```
Method `advance!` moves a solution from previous step `n-1` to current step `n` along a solution path of N solution nodes by integrating its governing differential equation for stretch using a backward difference formula (BDF) when given the fiber's time rate-of-change in stretch `dLambda` subject to an initial condition of Œª(0) = 1. For a time-step interval of [t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ, t‚Çô], Œª‚Ä≤ = dŒª/dt associates with either time t‚Çô when using an end-point quadrature rule, or with time (t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + t‚Çô)/2 when using a mid-point quadrature rule.

This method updates counter `k.n` and entries to its history arrays at the n·µó ∞ array location in the `k` data structure; specifically: stretch `k.Œª[n]` and its rate `k.Œª‚Ä≤[n]`, plus strain `k.œµ[n]` and its rate `k.œµ‚Ä≤[n].` These fields are evaluated at either the end-point, i.e. at time t‚Çô, or at the mid-point, i.e. at time (t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + t‚Çô)/2, according to the argument `midPtQuad` supplied to its constructor.

A solution at current node `k.n` can be refined by calling the method
```
function update!(k::FiberKinematics, dLambda::PhysicalScalar)
```
Method `update!` refines a solution at step `n` by re-integrating its governing differential equation for fiber stretch, thereby allowing for iterative improvements to be made on stretch rate `dLambda` from an external algorithm, e.g., a finite element engine. There is no need to call `update!` unless Œª‚Ä≤ is being iteratively refined at step n, e.g., by some external optimization process. Here dLambda = Œª‚Ä≤ = dŒª(k.t[n])/dt.

## Laplace Kinematics for 2D Membranes

Membranes are planar structures that do not support an out-of-plane bending moment. The user's base vectors are denoted as (ùïö, ùïõ) that when pivoted to ensure a physical interpretation for shears become (**e**‚ÇÅ, **e**‚ÇÇ). A data structure that holds kinematic fields for a membrane described by a Gram-Schmidt deconstruction of the deformation gradient **F** = *F·µ¢‚±º* **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º is given by
```

end
```
where types `MInteger,` `PhysicalScalar,` `PhysicalTensor,` `ArrayOfPhysicalScalars` and `ArrayOfPhysicalTensors` are all exported by module `PhysicalFields.`

There are four stretch attributes that describe a planar Laplace stretch at nodal time `t‚Çô:` elongations `a‚Çô` and `b‚Çô,` an in-plane shear `Œ≥‚Çô,` and a Gram rotation `œâ‚Çô.` Gram rotations are physical. They either associate with a rigid-body rotation or a pure shear. This physicality is ensured through a co-ordinate permutation. Permutation `P‚ÇÅ` associates with a right-handed co-ordinate frame, while permutation `P‚ÇÇ` associates with a left-handed co-ordinate frame. From the above Laplace stretch attributes come three thermodynamic strains: dilation `Œ¥,` squeeze `œµ,` and simple shear `Œ≥.` It is in terms of these three strains and their rates that constitutive equations are to be constructed.

### Internal Constructors

The constructor most likely to be used by a programmer is
```
function MembraneKinematics(dTime::PhysicalScalar, N::Int64, midPtQuad::Bool, aRef::PhysicalScalar, bRef::PhysicalScalar, Œ≥Ref::PhysicalScalar, PRef::Int64)
```
which returns a new data structure `k` of type `MembraneKinematics` that holds a variety of kinematic fields. Arguments include: (i) A differential step in time `dTime` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced over time. (ii) The number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays, e.g., t[1] = 0. (iii) A boolean flag `midPtQuad` that, if true, implies the nodal spacing is for a mid-point quadrature rule, and if false, implies the nodal spacing is for an end-point quadrature rule. This determines how the array of independent times is to be populated. (iv) The reference Laplace stretch attributes, viz., `aRef`, `bRef` and `Œ≥Ref`, against which isochoric strains are to be established so that œµ(aRef, bRef, Œ≥Ref) = 0, with the membrane's initial deformation gradient F‚ÇÄ, associated with some initial configuration Œ∫‚ÇÄ, being assigned the identity matrix I with an outcome being that œµ(a‚ÇÄ, b‚ÇÄ, Œ≥‚ÇÄ) need not equal 0. And (v) if Œ≥Ref is to be a shearing in the ùïö direction then `PRef` is to equal 1, else if Œ≥·µ£ is to be a shearing in the ùïõ direction then `PRef` is to equal 2, where PRef denotes which permutation matrix it to be applied in the reference configuration.

The constructor used by JSON3 and other external constructors is
```
function MembraneKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Int64, n::MInteger, a·µ£::PhysicalScalar, b·µ£::PhysicalScalar, Œ≥·µ£::PhysicalScalar, t::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, F::ArrayOfPhysicalTensors, F‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalTensors, motion::Vector{Int64}, œâ‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œâ‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, a‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, b‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, a‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, b‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ¥::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ¥‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars)
```
which is a serialization of the fields comprising an instance of type `MembraneKinematics.`

## Methods

### Copies

For making a shallow copy of an object of type `MembraneKinematics,` use
```
function Base.:(copy)(k::MembraneKinematics)::MembraneKinematics
```
and for making a deep copy of an object of type `MembraneKinematics,`, use
```
function Base.:(deepcopy)(k::MembraneKinematics)::MembraneKinematics
```

### Persistence

To write an object of type `MembraneKinematics` to a JSON file, one can call
```
function toFile(k::MembraneKinematics, json_stream::IOStream)
```
while reading in such an object from a JSON file can be accomplished by calling
```
function fromFile(::Type{MembraneKinematics}, json_stream::IOStream)::MembraneKinematics
```
wherein a `json_stream` for writing to a JSON file can be created from a call to
```
function PhysicalFields.openJSONWriter(my_dir_path::String, my_file_name::String)::IOStream
```
while a `json_stream` for reading from a JSON file can be created by calling

```
with
```
function PhysicalFields.closeJSONStream(json_stream::IOStream)
```
closing a `json_stream.`

### Solver

To advance a solution along its path, step by step, call the method
```
function advance!(k::MembraneKinematics, dF::PhysicalTensor)
```
which moves a solution from previous step `n-1` to current step `n` along a solution path of N solution nodes by integrating its governing differential equation for the 2D deformation gradient using a backward difference formula (BDF). Supplied is the membrane's time rate-of-change in its deformation gradient `dF` evaluated in the user's co-ordinate system (ùïö, ùïõ). The initial condition of this differential equation is taken to be F‚ÇÄ = I, i.e., k.F[1] = F‚ÇÄ = I where I is the identity matrix. For a time-step interval of [t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ, t‚Çô], dF = F‚Ä≤ = dF/dt associates with either time t‚Çô when using end-point quadrature, or with time (t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + t‚Çô)/2 when using mid-point quadrature.

This method updates counter `k.n` and entries to its history arrays at the n·µó ∞ array location in the `k` data structure; specifically: deformation gradient `k.F[n]` and its rate `k.F‚Ä≤[n]`, motion case `k.motion[n]`, Laplace stretch attributes `k.a‚Çô[n]`, `k.b‚Çô[n]`, `k.Œ≥‚Çô[n]` and `k.œâ‚Çô[n]` and their rates `k.a‚Ä≤‚Çô[n]`, `k.b‚Ä≤‚Çô[n]`, `k.Œ≥‚Ä≤‚Çô[n]` and `k.œâ‚Ä≤‚Çô[n]`, plus Laplace strain attributes `k.Œ¥[n]`, `k.œµ[n]` and `k.Œ≥[n]` and their rates `k.Œ¥‚Ä≤[n]`, `k.œµ‚Ä≤[n]` and `k.Œ≥‚Ä≤[n]`, all mapped to the user's co-ordinate system whose base vectors are denoted as (ùïö, ùïõ). These fields are evaluated at either the end-point, i.e. at time t‚Çô, or at the mid-point, i.e. at time (t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + t‚Çô)/2, according to the argument `midPtQuad` supplied to its constructor.

A solution at current node `k.n` can be refined by calling the method
```
function update!(k::MembraneKinematics, dF::PhysicalTensor)
```
Such a refinement is accomplished by re-integrating the deformation gradient rate `dF`, thereby allowing for iterative improvements to be made on the deformation rate `dF` from an external algorithm, e.g., a finite element engine. There is no need to call `update!` unless `dF` is being iteratively refined at step `n` by some external optimization process. Here dF = F‚Ä≤ = dF(k.t[n])/dt.

## Version History

### Version 0.1.7

Bug fix in the BDF solvers.

### Version 0.1.5

The initial configuration is chosen to have a displacement gradient that is the identity tensor. Kinematic analyses are now considered to be at a mass or continuum point. Structural information is no longer contained within these data structures. For example, what were lengths are now dimensionless stretches.

### Version 0.1.4

Allow for distinction between mid-point and end-point quadrature rules. This is handled through their constructors.

### Version 0.1.3

Removed geometric fields that were in addition to the fundamental kinematic fields. This was done to simplify data structures built upon those exported here for Laplace kinematics.

### Version 0.1.2

Initial public release.
