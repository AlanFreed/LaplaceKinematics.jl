# LaplaceKinematics.jl

This module provides a **QR** or Gram-Schmidt factorization of a deformation gradient tensor **F** = *F·µ¢‚±º* **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º, where *i*,*j* ‚àà {1,2} for 2D analyses or *i*,*j* ‚àà {1,2,3} for 3D analyses, with *F·µ¢‚±º* being its matrix of tensor components evaluated in basis (**e**‚ÇÅ, **e**‚ÇÇ) for 2D analyses or in basis (**e**‚ÇÅ, **e**‚ÇÇ, **e**‚ÇÉ) for 3D analyses. Here **Q** = Q·µ¢‚±º **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º is an orthogonal matrix known as the Gram rotation tensor, and **R** = *R·µ¢‚±º* **e**·µ¢ ‚äó **e**‚±º is an upper-triangular matrix known as Laplace stretch tensor. In the mechanics literature, this decomposition is often denoted as **F** = **RU**, where **R** denotes the Gram rotation and **U** denotes the Laplace stretch.

    # Properties of the arrays.

end
```
where types `MInteger,` `PhysicalScalar` and `ArrayOfPhysicalScalars` are exported by module `PhysicalFields.` These fields are self explanatory.

### Internal Constructors

The constructor most likely to be used by a programmer is
```
function FiberKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Integer, L·µ£::PhysicalScalar, A·µ£::PhysicalScalar, L‚ÇÄ::PhysicalScalar)
```
which returns a new data structure of type `FiberKinematics` that holds kinematic fields pertinent to the modeling of an isochoric 1D fiber. Arguments are: (*i*) A differential step in time `dt` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced in time. (*ii*) The total number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays. (*iii*) The reference (or strain free) length `L·µ£` and cross-sectional area `A·µ£` of a fiber against which strains are to be measured. And (*iv*) a fiber's initial length `L‚ÇÄ` in some initial configuration selected for analysis Œ∫‚ÇÄ, where typically L‚ÇÄ ‚â• L·µ£. An isochoric (or constant volume) motion is assumed.

The constructor used by JSON3 and other external constructors is
```
function FiberKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Integer, n::MInteger, t::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, L·µ£::PhysicalScalar, A·µ£::PhysicalScalar, L::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, L‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, A::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, A‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars)
```
which is a serialization of the fields comprising type `FiberKinematics.`

## Methods

### Copies

For making a shallow copy of an object of type `FiberKinematics,` use
```
function Base.:(copy)(k::FiberKinematics)::FiberKinematics
```
and for making a deep copy of an object of type `FiberKinematics,`, use
```
function Base.:(deepcopy)(k::FiberKinematics)::FiberKinematics
```

### Persistence

To write an object of type `FiberKinematics` to a JSON file, one can call
```
function toFile(y::FiberKinematics, json_stream::IOStream)
```
while reading in such an object from a JSON file can be accomplished by calling
```
function fromFile(::Type{FiberKinematics}, json_stream::IOStream)::FiberKinematics
```
wherein a `json_stream` for writing to a JSON file can be created from a call to
```
function PhysicalFields.openJSONWriter(my_dir_path::String, my_file_name::String)::IOStream
```
while a `json_stream` for reading from a JSON file can be created by calling
```
function PhysicalFields.openJSONReader(my_dir_path::String, my_file_name::String)::IOStream
```
with
```
function PhysicalFields.closeJSONStream(json_stream::IOStream)
```
closing a `json_stream.`

### Solver

To advance a solution along its path, step by step, call the method
```
function advance!(k::FiberKinematics, L‚Ä≤::PhysicalScalar)
```
Method `advance!` moves a solution from a previous step `n-1` to its current step `n` along a solution path containing N+1 nodes. The initial values/conditions are stored at array locations [1] with their `N` solutions being stored at locations [2] to [N+1]. Advancement is accomplished by integrating a differential equation describing length using a backward difference formula (BDF), when given the fiber's current time rate-of-change in length `L‚Ä≤` as an argument of `advance!.`

A call to this method advances counter `k.n` and inserts entries into its history arrays at the n·µó ∞ array location in the `k` data structure; specifically: length `k.L[n]` and its rate `k.L‚Ä≤[n]`, area `k.A[n]` and its rate `k.A‚Ä≤[n]`, plus strain `k.œµ[n]` and its rate `k.œµ‚Ä≤[n]` are all assigned to the data arrays of a `FiberKinematics` object by this solver.

A solution at current node `k.n` can be refined by calling the method
```
function update!(k::FiberKinematics, L‚Ä≤::PhysicalScalar)
```
Such a refinement is accomplished by re-integrating its governing differential equation for fiber length, thereby allowing for iterative improvements to be made throughout the data structure. There is no need to call `update!` unless `L‚Ä≤` is being iteratively refined at step `n`, e.g., through some external optimization process like a finite element engine.

                                 # (ùïñ‚ÇÇ, ùïñ‚ÇÅ) out of (ùïö, ùïõ) whenever P = P‚ÇÇ

end
```
where types `MInteger,` `PhysicalScalar,` `PhysicalTensor,` `ArrayOfPhysicalScalars` and `ArrayOfPhysicalTensors` are all exported by module `PhysicalFields.`

There are four stretch attributes that describe a planar Laplace stretch at nodal time `t‚Çô:` elongations `a‚Çô` and `b‚Çô,` an in-plane shear `Œ≥‚Çô,` and a Gram rotation `œâ‚Çô.` Gram rotations are physical. They either associate with a rigid-body rotation or a pure shear. This physicality is ensured through a co-ordinate permutation. Permutation `P‚ÇÅ` associates with a right-handed co-ordinate frame, while permutation `P‚ÇÇ` associates with a left-handed co-ordinate frame. From the above Laplace stretch attributes come three thermodynamic strains: dilation `Œ¥,` squeeze `œµ,` and simple shear `Œ≥.` It is in terms of these three strains and their rates that constitutive equations can be constructed.

### Internal Constructors

The constructor most likely to be used by a programmer is
```
function MembraneKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Integer, a·µ£::PhysicalScalar, b·µ£::PhysicalScalar, Œ≥·µ£::PhysicalScalar, F‚ÇÄ::PhysicalTensor)
```
which returns a new data structure of type `MembraneKinematics` that holds kinematic fields pertinent to the modeling of an isochoric 2D membrane. Arguments are: (*i*) A differential step in time `dt` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced in time. (*ii*) The total number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays. (*iii*) The reference (or strain free) elongations are: `a·µ£` and `b·µ£,` along with a simple shear `Œ≥·µ£.` They associate with a membrane deformation of `Œ∫‚ÇÄ ‚Ü¶ Œ∫·µ£,` with configuration `Œ∫·µ£` being that configuration against which strains are to be measured. And (*iv*) a membrane's initial 2x2 deformation gradient `F‚ÇÄ` evaluated in some initial configuration selected for analysis `Œ∫‚ÇÄ` in an user specified co-ordinate system with base vectors (ùïö, ùïõ). Laplace tensors are evaluated in a frame-indifferent co-ordinate system (ùïñ‚ÇÅ, ùïñ‚ÇÇ), which are then mapped to the user's co-ordinate system (ùïö, ùïõ). It is in the (ùïö, ùïõ) co-ordinate system that the kinematic fields of this data structure are quantified in. An isochoric (or constant volume) motion is assumed.

The constructor used by JSON3 and other external constructors is
```
function MembraneKinematics(dt::PhysicalScalar, N::Integer, n::MInteger, t::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, F::ArrayOfPhysicalTensors, F‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalTensors, P::Vector, a·µ£::PhysicalScalar, b·µ£::PhysicalScalar, Œ≥·µ£::PhysicalScalar, œâ‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œâ‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, a‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, b‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, a‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, b‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Ä≤‚Çô::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ¥::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ¥‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, œµ‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars, Œ≥‚Ä≤::ArrayOfPhysicalScalars)
```
which is a serialization of the fields comprising type `MembraneKinematics.`

## Methods

### Copies

For making a shallow copy of an object of type `MembraneKinematics,` use
```
function Base.:(copy)(k::MembraneKinematics)::MembraneKinematics
```
and for making a deep copy of an object of type `MembraneKinematics,`, use
```
function Base.:(deepcopy)(k::MembraneKinematics)::MembraneKinematics
```

### Persistence

To write an object of type `MembraneKinematics` to a JSON file, one can call
```
function toFile(y::MembraneKinematics, json_stream::IOStream)
```
while reading in such an object from a JSON file can be accomplished by calling

```
with
```
function PhysicalFields.closeJSONStream(json_stream::IOStream)
```
closing a `json_stream.`

### Solver

To advance a solution along its path, step by step, call the method
```
function advance!(k::MembraneKinematics, F‚Ä≤‚Çô::PhysicalTensor)
```
Method `advance!` moves a solution from a previous step `n-1` to its current step `n` along some solution path containing N+1 nodes. This is accomplished by integrating the supplied rate of deformation gradient `F‚Ä≤‚Çô` using a backward difference formula (BDF) from which all other fields are then derived and assigned to their appropriate arrays. 

This method advances counter `k.n` plus it assigns values to its history arrays located at the n·µó ∞ array entries in the `k` data structure. Specifically, assignments are made to: the deformation gradient `k.F[n]` and its rate `k.F‚Ä≤[n],` the pivot case `k.P[n],` the Laplace attributes `k.a‚Çô[n],` `k.b‚Çô[n],` `k.Œ≥‚Çô[n]` and `k.œâ‚Çô[n]` and their rates `k.a‚Ä≤‚Çô[n],` `k.b‚Ä≤‚Çô[n],` `k.Œ≥‚Ä≤‚Çô[n]` and `k.œâ‚Ä≤‚Çô[n],` plus the Laplace strains `k.Œ¥[n],` `k.œµ[n]` and `k.Œ≥[n]` and their rates `k.Œ¥‚Ä≤[n],` `k.œµ‚Ä≤[n]` and `k.Œ≥‚Ä≤[n].` All of these fields have values that associate with the user's co-ordinate system, whose base vectors are denoted as (ùïö, ùïõ).

A solution at current node `k.n` can be refined by calling the method
```
function update!(k::MembraneKinematics, F‚Ä≤‚Çô::PhysicalTensor)
```
Such a refinement is accomplished by re-integrating its governing differential equation for the 2D deformation gradient, thereby allowing for iterative improvements to be made throughout the data structure. There is no need to call `update!` unless `F‚Ä≤‚Çô` is being iteratively refined at step `n`, e.g., through some external optimization process like a finite element engine.
