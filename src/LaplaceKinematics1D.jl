    Returns a new data structure `k` of type `FiberKinematics` that holds kinematic fields pertinent to the modeling of an isochoric 1D fiber. Arguments are: (i) A differential step in time `dt` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced in time. (ii) The total number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays. (iii) The reference (or strain free) length `L·µ£` and cross-sectional area `A·µ£` of a fiber against which strains are to be measured. And (iv) a fiber's initial length `L‚ÇÄ` in some initial configuration selected for analysis Œ∫‚ÇÄ, where typically L‚ÇÄ ‚â• L·µ£. An isochoric (or constant volume) motion is assumed.
