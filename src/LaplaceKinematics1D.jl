    Returns a new data structure `k` of type `FiberKinematics` that holds kinematic fields pertinent to the modeling of a 1D fiber. Arguments are: (i) A differential step in time `dTime` that separates neighboring nodes, which themselves are taken to be uniformly spaced in time. (ii) The total number of grid points or nodes `N` where solutions are to be computed. The data arrays are of length N+1 with initial values/conditions being stored at location [1] in these arrays. (iii) A boolean flag `midPtQuad` that, if true, implies the nodal spacing is for a mid-point quadrature rule and, if false, implies the nodal spacing is for an end-point quadrature rule. This determines how the array of independent times is populated. (iv) The reference (or strain free) length `L·µ£` of a fiber against which strains are to be measured. And (v) a fiber's initial length `L‚ÇÄ` in some initial configuration selected for analysis Œ∫‚ÇÄ where, typically, L‚ÇÄ ‚â• L·µ£.
